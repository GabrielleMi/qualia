# QUALIA
Puzzle platformer game with procedural generation.

## Origin
This game was originally a homework developed back in 2020, heavily inspired by [Limbo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limbo_%28video_game%29) and [Inside](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inside_(video_game)). I decided to remake it as a hobby and to improve my C# skills.

## Gameplay
The game is made of procedural generated puzzles that can be resolved by cloning the main character.
